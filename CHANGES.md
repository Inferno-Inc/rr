# Changelog

## 1.1.0 (UNRELEASED)

* Fix a line in RR::Injections::DoubleInjection to use top-level RR constant
  [Thibaut]
* Fix all wildcard matches so they work within hashes and arrays. This means
  that `stub([hash_containing(:foo => 'bar')])` will match
  `stub([{:foo => 'bar', :baz => 'qux'}])`.
* RR now auto-hooks into whichever test framework you have loaded; there is no
  longer a need to `include RR::Adapters::Whatever` into your test framework. If
  you don't like the autohook and prefer the old way, simply use
  `require 'rr/without_autohook'` instead of `require 'rr'`. (There are now
  seven adapters; see lib/rr/adapters for the full list.)
* Fix Test::Unit adapters to ensure that any additional teardown is completely
  run in the event that RR's verify step produces an error. This was causing
  weirdness when using Test::Unit alongside Rails.
* Add an explicit Test::Unit / ActiveSupport adapter. As ActiveSupport::TestCase
  introduces its own setup/teardown hooks, use these when autohooking in RR.
* Upon release, the tests are now packaged up and uploaded to S3. This is for
  Linux distros like Fedora who wrap gems in RPM packages. You can always find
  the latest tests at: <http://s3.amazonaws.com/rubygem-rr/tests/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz>,
  where X.Y.Z represents a version. I have retroactively packaged the tests for
  1.0.4 and 1.0.5.
* General cleanup and that sort of thing.

## 1.0.5 (2013-03-28)

* Compatibility with RSpec-2. There are now two adapters for RSpec, one that
  works with RSpec-1 and a new one that works with RSpec-2. Currently, saying
  `RSpec.configure {|c| c.mock_with(:rr) }` still uses RSpec-1; to use the new
  one, you say `RSpec.configure {|c| c.mock_framework = RR::Adapters::RSpec2 }`.
  (#66, #68, #80) [njay, james2m]
* Fix MethodMissingInjection so that `[stub].flatten` works without throwing a
  NoMethodError (undefined method #to_ary) error under Ruby 1.9 (#44)
* Raise a MiniTest::Assertion error in the MiniTest adapter so that mock
  failures appear in the output as failures rather than uncaught exceptions
  (#69) [jayferd]
* Completely remove leftover #new_instance_of method, and also remove
  mention of #new_instance_of from the README
* Fix tests so they all work and pass again

## 1.0.1 (2010-10-30)

## 0.10.4 (2009-09-26)

* Handle lazily defined methods (where respond_to? returns true yet the method
  is not yet defined and the first call to method_missing defines the method).
  This pattern is used in ActiveRecord and ActionMailer.
